					Having the opportunity to play a sport for a post-secondary institution is a huge privilege and challenge. It is a challenge because it is a 40+ hour commitment weekly that includes: <em>training</em>, <em>practice</em>, <em>meetings/team development</em>, and <em>competition</em>. However, through this I have developed my time management skills to effectively manage the very busy schedule that I have.

					As a member of a varsity sport at the University of Calgary I was given the opportunity to volunteer for <a class="exp-link" href="https://www.cfs-ab.org/"><em>Catholic Family Services</em></a>. This organization pairs a varsity athlete of a Calgary university with an at-risk youth through the <a class="exp-link" href="https://www.boysandgirlsclubsofcalgary.ca/"><em>Boys and Girls Club</em></a> of Calgary. A weekly meetup is arranged and you get together with your mentee to play games, hangout, and just talk about life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being a part of this program has been beyond rewarding as I have seen shy, timid kids change into leaders and role models for the other young kids in the program. I've developed much stronger communication skills through this proccess and look to continue to grow as a strong and responsible role model for kids to strive towards.

					During the Fall of 2018 I was one of two athletes selected from the Mens Varsity Volleyball program to take part in a year long leadership camp designed to foster captain-like characteristics in athletes.The athletes selected from each team are looked at as potential captains of their respective teams in the following school year.

					I durastically improved upon many skills: <em>Personality profiling</em>, <em>Leadership integrity</em>, <em>Communication skills</em>, <em>Conflict Management</em>.
