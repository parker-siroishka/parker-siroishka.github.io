				<p class="job-text">
					Working at 4iiii was an amazing opportunity. I was learning about so many different types of technologies and professional practices that I otherwise would not have been exposed to.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had the opportunity to be the sole developer and designer in the development of a new product that 4iiii was looking to roll out to potential clients. I learned how to program and assemble ultrasonic sensors to be used in millimetre-level distance tracking across large spaces and buildings. By using a <a class="exp-link" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"><em>Raspberry Pi</em></a> as a testbed for development, I got my feet wet in electrical engineering and learned the basics of programming with embedded systems.
					I gained experience in <em>Python</em> programming through data analysis libraries such as <a class="exp-link" href="https://matplotlib.org/"><em>Matplotlib</em></a> and <a class="exp-link" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"><em>pandas</em></a> by deriving meaning from large data sets. I utilized inferences from my analysis to base developmental decions I was to make. This sparked my interest in the field of Data Science. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I thouroughly enjoyed my time compiling all my research and abstracting it down into an easily digestible and marketable presentation to present to interested companies. These presentations were well recieved by multiple market-leading cargo carrier companies.

				<hr class="experience">
				<p class="job-text">
					During my first four month summer of my life; inbetween years 1 & 2 at the University of Calgary, I worked alone at an outdoor wading pool, Riley Park in Calgary, Alberta.
				</p>
				<p class="job-text">
					I was tasked with managing the chemical balances in the pool water. Which entailed doing pH tests around the clock, and dispersing correct amounts of chlorine or acid through the pump system depending on the test results. Doing this job solo taught me much about personal responsibility and accountability. Alongside managing the water I was in charge of the quality of the grounds, changing facilities, and bathing facilities. This responsibility gave me a sense of pride in doing my best to have <em>my</em> pool represented in the best possible light.
				</p>
				<p class="job-text">
					These traits have transferred over to other professional endeavors as well as in school. I feel a sense of pride putting forth the best version of what I can create or accomplish.
